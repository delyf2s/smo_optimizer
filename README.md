# SMO Optimizer

Selective Momentum Optimizer (SMO) is an adaptive optimizer designed for tasks involving spatial or sequential delta vectors.  
It dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the composition of the batch,  
focusing training on relevant patterns while reducing the impact of noisy or less informative data.

### Efficiency

SMO can reduce computational cost by 30â€“60% during training and inference,  
allowing faster and more resource-efficient model development with minimal accuracy loss.
